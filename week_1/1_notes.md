# Week 1 Notes

## Welcome to Machine Learning - Video
Examples:
- Google search - ranking the pages
- Photos tagging and recognizing in social networks
- Spam detecting

Machine learning is the science of getting computers to lear, without being explicitly programmed.

- Робот чистачка - демонстрира му се дадено действие (чистене, подреждане) и той го повтаря.
    - Robots to tidy up the house
    
## Machine Learning Honor Code - Reading
- "How do I subset a matrix to **eliminate** the **intercept**?"
- Octave code - https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/
- https://octave-online.net/

## Welcome - Video
- State of the art
- state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms
 
Examples
- Database mining - Large datasets from growth of automation/web
    - web click data (click stream data)
    - medical records (understanding diseases better by patients information) 
    - biology - ML gives us a much better understanding of the human
    - engineering
- Applications can't program by hand
    - Autonomous helicopter - the only thing that worked is was having a computer learn by itself how to fly this helicopter.
    - Handwriting recognition - many services read your mail with machine learning algorithms
    - Natural Language Processing (NLP) - understanding language
    - Computer Vision - understanding language - understanding images
- Self-customizing programs - Amazon and netflix ratings, products recomendations
- Understanding human learning (brain, real AI)

## What is Machine Learning? - Video
- There isn't a well accepted definition of what is and what isn't machine lerning.
- Arthur Samuel - Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
    - Checkers playing program - Computer has a patience to play thousands games to learn himself good and bad positions. Human doesnt has the patience to play that many games.
- Tom Michael Mitchell (1998) - Well-posed Learning Problem: 
    - A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E
    - Carnegie Melon
    - Checkers playing example:
        - Experience E - the experience of having the program play tens of thousands of games itself.
        - Task T - would be the task of playing checkers
        - Performance measure P - the probability that wins the next game of checkers against some new opponent
    - Spam example
        - Task T - would be the task of filtering spam - Classifying emails as spam or not spam
        - Task E - watching you label emails as spam or not spam
        - Task P - The number (or fraction) of emails correctly classified as spam/not spam.
- The main two types of learning algorithms are:
    - In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:
        - Supervised learning - we're going to teach the computer how to do something
        - Unsupervised learning - we're going to let it learn by itself
    - Others: Reinforcement learning, recommender systems
    - Also talk about: Practical advice for applying learning algorithms
- The machine learning algorithms are the tools - we will learn how to use these tools
- Analogy to learning to become a carpenter - algorithms = tools
